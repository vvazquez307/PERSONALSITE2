          This project is special to me because it is the last project I worked
          on at fullstack. The name of the project is DriveZe, and I worked on
          it along with 3 other classmates. DriveZe Website features safe
          login/register/logout, all products page, a locations page that
          features google maps, a profile section where the logged in user can
          edit their information, cart and checkout, as well as admin
          functionality so that products/hubs can be updated online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention this whole project has its own database that the
          website can pull data from it by using api calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Backend of this project was all made with postgresql, and bcrypt
          for hashing information. The frontend was made using react and
          react-router-dom for that effortless route making, css for styling the
          whole website. DriveZe was deployed using netlify. For more
          information visit the DriveZe repo:{" "}
